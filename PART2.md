## Problems Encountered & Solutions

Describe the problems encountered and provide the solutions / plan for the solutions.

1. If zombie restricted with no space to move, it will loop indefinitely. <br />
Solution: make the if else statement that check the location of the zombie n if it is restricted by border or other zombie.

2. Finding range of alien from zombie.<br />
Solution: range = diffX + diffY.

3. The nearest zombie from pod.<br />
Solution: run loop checking for nearest zombie, if nearer it will clear a vector, and put the new nearest zombie, if there are 2 or more that same, it will randomly choosed.

4. Winning the game.<br />
